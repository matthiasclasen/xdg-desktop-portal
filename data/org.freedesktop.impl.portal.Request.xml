      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request:
      @short_description: shared request interface

      The Request interface is shared by all portal backend interfaces.
      When a backend method is called, the backend exports a Request object
      on the object path that was sent with the method call. The Request
      will stay alive for the duration of the user interaction related to
      the method call.

      The backend indicates that the user interaction is over by emitting
      the #org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request::Response signal on the
      Request object.

      The portal can abort the interaction calling
      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request.Close() on the Request object.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request">

    <!--
        Close:

        Ends the user interaction (dialogs, etc) to which this object refers.
        A Response signal will not be emitted in this case.
    -->
    <method name="Close">
    </method>

    <!--
        Response:
        @response: numeric response
        @results: A vardict with results. The keys and values in the vardict depend on the request.

        Emitted when the user interaction for a portal request is over.

        The @response indicates how the user interaction ended:
            <simplelist>
              <member>0: Success, the request is carried out</member>
              <member>1: The user cancelled the interaction</member>
              <member>2: The user interaction was ended in some other way</member>
            </simplelist>
    -->
    <signal name="Response">
      <arg type="u" name="response"/>
      <arg type="a{sv}" name="results"/>
    </signal>
  </interface>
