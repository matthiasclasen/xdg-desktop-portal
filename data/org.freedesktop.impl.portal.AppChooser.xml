      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.AppChooser:
      @short_description: interface for choosing an application

      This backend can be used by portal implementations that
      need to choose an application from a list of applications.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.impl.portal.AppChooser">
    <!--
        ChooseApplication:
        @handle: object path to export the Request object at
        @app_id: the app id of the application
        @title: title for the app chooser dialog
        @parent_window: identifier for the application window
        @choices: app ids of applications to let the user choose from
        @options: a  vardict with optional further information

        Presents a list of applications to the user to choose one.

        The @parent_window identifier must be of the form "x11:$XID" for an X11
        window. Support for other window systems may be added in the future.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>latest-choice s</term>
            <listitem><para>The app id that was selected the last time.</para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

      The following results get returned via the org.fredesktop.impl.portal.Request::Response signal:
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>choice s</term>
